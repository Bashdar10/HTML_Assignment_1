            Sulaymaniyah, also spelled as Slemani (Kurdish: سلێمانی, romanized: Silêmanî,[3][4] Arabic: السليمانية, romanized: as-Sulaymāniyyah[5]), 
            is a city in the east of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, not far from the Iran–Iraq border. 
            It is surrounded by the Azmar, Goizha and Qaiwan Mountains in the northeast, 
            Baranan Mountain in the south and the Tasluja Hills in the west. 
            The city has a semi-arid climate with very hot dry summers and cold wet winters.

        Sulaymaniyah is the only city in <em>South Kurdistan</em> that regularly celebrates World Music Day or Fête de la Musique. 
        <mark>In one trip to the city,</mark>  <u> a journalist working </u> for the BBC wrote about Sulaymaniyah's distinct culture:
        <Strong>"Culture is hugely important to the Kurdish people,</Strong> especially in Sulaymaniyah, 
        but there is a strong pull to the west—modernisation and consumerism—driven perhaps by the satellite televisions 
        they have had access to since they started running their own affairs...And at the university, students mill around 
        the campus chattering with each other and doing some last-minute cramming for their exams. 
        The war only stopped lectures for a few weeks. There are probably more women than men and they are 
        happy to air their views to anyone who asks.
